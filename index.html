        <p>About me</p>
<p>I was 19 when I started <a href="http://www.webchutney.com/" target="_blank">Webchutney</a>, India’s leading digital agency as its co-founder and <span class="small-caps">CEO</span>.</p>
<p>Ranked as India’s #1 digital agency for eight years by the Economic Times &amp; Brand Equity, Webchutney works with some of the leading brands and companies in India including Flipkart, Google, Uber, Swiggy, WeWork, Ikea, Under Armour, Airtel, Tata Sons, Whirlpool amongst others.</p>
<p>In 2008, I incubated Network Play under Webchutney, which in less than three years became the largest brand ad-network, one that was later acquired by Bertelsmann <span class="small-caps">AG</span>.</p>
<p>In 2013, Webchutney was acquired by Dentsu Aegis Network, one of the largest agency networks globally.</p>
<p>Dentsu Webchutney was the most-awarded Indian agency at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in 2019.</p>
<p>I have been a proud member of the global digital advisory board at Unilever and served in the jury of some of the most celebrated advertising festivals in India and around the globe.</p>
<p>I am an active angel investor in India. Some of my investments include <a href="http://www.scoopwhoop.com/" target="_blank">ScoopWhoop</a>, <a href="http://www.loanzen.in/" target="_blank">LoanZen</a>, <a href="http://www.invideo.io/" target="_blank">Invideo</a>, <a href="http://www.coho.in/" target="_blank">CoHo</a>. Many more are in the graveyard. Direct to consumer is a space I am very excited about right now; most of my investing recently has been in that space.<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">’</span><a href="https://www.amazon.in/How-Almost-Blew-Sidharth-Rao-ebook/dp/B07TV4YG5B/" target="_blank">How I almost blew it</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> is my first book.</p>
<p>Twitter is the best place to reach me. I am right here -&gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/sidharthrao" target="_blank">@sidharthrao</a></p>
