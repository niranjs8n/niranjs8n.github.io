  <br />
  <p align="justify">
    Availability is the actual time your service is accessible i.e up and ready to serve customer requests.
    Its different from 'uptime' which is a system reliability metric i.e. actual time your server is up, powered on and available for system administration. The server may be up and running but the service(s) may still be unavailable so uptime is not a good measure of service availability.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p align="justify">
    Lets say for the past month your service had 5 outage incidents causing a total outage of 12 hours. How do you calculate your service availability?
  </p>
  <br />
  <p align="justify">
    We start by calculating the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) which is the average time between one security incident to next. <br/>

  </p>
  <br />
  <p align="justify">
    Next we calculate the Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) which is the average time to resolve an outage and restore service(s) back to customers. <br/>

  </p>
  <br />
  <p align="justify">
    Once we have the above numbers, we can calculate Availability as shown below. <br/>

  </p>
  <p align="justify">
    Availability is a key performance indicator to track on a weekly/monthly basis. <br/>
