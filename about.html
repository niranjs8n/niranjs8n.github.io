        <p>Hey there!</p>

        <p align="justify">Thanks for stopping by! My first tryst with a camera was learning to shoot family pictures using my dad's Yashica (1970, film) bought during his trip to Singapore. It stayed in our family for a really long time, a reliable companion during our family vacations. The romance of shooting film, the processing from negatives and the anticipation to find out how those 36 images turned out is lost in the digital world. Sigh! Although, my romance with photography is evergreen!</p>
